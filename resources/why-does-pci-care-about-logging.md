# 🎙️ Micro-Lecture: Why Does PCI Care About Logging?

Imagine someone breaks into your house—and you don’t have cameras, no logs, no fingerprints.

That’s what a system without logging looks like. And PCI DSS cares deeply about this.

## 🔍 Key Points

- PCI Requirement **10.x** is all about capturing evidence of access and activity.
- Logs are the audit trail that prove intent, actions, and outcomes.
- Requirement **10.2.x** covers WHAT is logged (e.g., access, privilege use).
- Requirement **10.3.1** ensures logs include user IDs, timestamps, and system component info.
- Requirement **10.5.1** requires protecting logs from tampering.
- Requirement **10.7.1** mandates retaining logs for **12 months**, with **3 months readily available**.

## 🎓 Analogy

> “Logs are like black boxes in an airplane—they help you reconstruct what happened when something goes wrong.”

Without logs, you can’t prove compliance. Worse—you can’t prove innocence.
