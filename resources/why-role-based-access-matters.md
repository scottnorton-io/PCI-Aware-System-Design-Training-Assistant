# 🎙️ Micro-Lecture: Why Role-Based Access Matters

Access control is more than logins. It’s about **who can do what**, and **why**.

## 🔐 PCI Focus

- **Requirement 7.2.2**: Access must be granted based on business need.
- **Requirement 8.3.1**: MFA is required for all admin/remote access.
- **Requirement 8.6.1**: No shared admin credentials—ever.

## 🔑 Real-World Impacts

- Audit trails become meaningless if accounts are shared.
- Overprovisioned roles = security debt waiting to blow up.
- IAM reviews catch privilege creep—before auditors do.

## 💡 Tip

> “Use roles like ‘Dev’, ‘Ops’, and ‘Auditor’—not blanket ‘Admin’ access.”

🎯 Ask yourself: “Who can log into production right now—and should they?”
